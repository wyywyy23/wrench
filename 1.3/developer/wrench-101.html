10,000-ft view of a simulated WMS</h1>
<p>A Workflow Management System (WMS), i.e., the software that makes all decisions and takes all actions for executing a workflow, is implemented in WRENCH as a simulated process. This process has a <code>main()</code> function that goes through a simple loop as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">while</span> ( workflow_execution_hasnt_completed_or_failed ) {</div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">// interact with services</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">// wait for an event</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-blueprint"></a>
Blueprint for a WMS in WRENCH</h1>
<p>A WMS implementation in WRENCH must derive the <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html" title="A workflow management system (WMS) ">wrench::WMS</a></code> class, and typically follows the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Get references to running services:</b> The <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html" title="A workflow management system (WMS) ">wrench::WMS</a></code> base class implements a set of methods named <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a6a2c05d2a60ce335588a25a1b0b7a8e3" title="Obtain the list of compute services available to the WMS. ">wrench::WMS::getAvailableComputeServices()</a></code>, <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#aa5a5f673888e1a455ef9fbaff531cb0c" title="Obtain the list of storage services available to the WMS. ">wrench::WMS::getAvailableStorageServices()</a></code>, etc. These methods return sets of services that can be used by the WMS to execute its workflow.</li>
<li><b>Acquire information about the services:</b> Some service classes provide methods to get information about the capabilities of the services. For instance, a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_compute_service.html" title="The compute service base class. ">wrench::ComputeService()</a></code> has a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_compute_service.html#a1b576a22529bd638e6998f0513a44b36" title="Get the number of hosts that the compute service manages. ">wrench::ComputeService::getNumHosts()</a></code> method that makes it possible to find out how many compute hosts the service has access to in total. A <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_storage_service.html" title="The storage service base class. ">wrench::StorageService</a></code> has a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_storage_service.html#a600a2fc0da8e1c5f1159509f09c2f2f6" title="Synchronously asks the storage service for its capacity. ">wrench::StorageService::getFreeSpace()</a></code> method to find out have many bytes of free space are available to it. Note that these methods actually involve communication with the service, and thus incur (simulated) overhead.</li>
<li><b>Go through a main loop:</b> The heart of the WMS's execution consists in going through a loop until the workflow is executed or has failed to execute. This loop consists of two main steps:<ul>
<li><b>Interact with services:</b> This is where the WMS can cause workflow files to be copied between storage services, and where workflow tasks can be submitted to compute services. See the <a href="#wrench-101-WMS-services">Interacting with services</a> section below for more details.</li>
<li><b>Wait for an event:</b> This is where the WMS is waiting for services to reply with "work done" or "work failed" events. See the <a href="#wrench-101-WMS-events">Workflow execution events</a> section for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-services"></a>
Interacting with services</h1>
<p>Each service type provides its own API. For instance, a network proximity service provides methods to query the service's host distance databases. The <a href="./annotated.html">API Reference</a> provides all necessary documentation, which also explains which methods are synchronous and which are asynchronous (in which case some <a href="#wrench-101-WMS-events">event</a> will likely occur in the future). <em>However</em>, the WRENCH developer will find that many methods that one would expect are nowhere to be found. For instance, the compute services do not have methods for compute job submissions!</p>
<p>The rationale for the above is that many methods need to be asynchronous so that the WMS can use services concurrently. For instance, a WMS could submit a compute job to two distinct compute services asynchronously, and then wait for the service which completes its job first and cancel the job on the other service. Exposing this asynchronicity to the WMS would require that the WRENCH developer uses data structures to perform the necessary bookkeeping of ongoing service interactions, and process incoming control messages from the services on the (simulated) network or register many callbacks. Instead, WRENCH provides <b>managers</b>. One can think of managers are separate threads that handle all asynchronous interactions with services, and which have been implemented for your convenience to make service interactions easy.</p>
<p>For now there are two possible managers: a <b>job manager</b> manager (class <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html" title="A helper daemon (co-located with and explicitly started by a WMS), which is used to handle all job ex...">wrench::JobManager</a></code>) and a <b>data movement manager</b> (class <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_data_movement_manager.html" title="A helper daemon (co-located with a WMS) that handles data movement operations. ">wrench::DataMovementManager</a></code>). The base <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html" title="A workflow management system (WMS) ">wrench::WMS</a></code> class provides two methods for instantiating and starting these managers: <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a3f1a1451efda2a41d2d96a41cf229698" title="Instantiate and start a job manager. ">wrench::WMS::createJobManager()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#aaf8902aadfd0542509cd0cae5519bcf3" title="Instantiate and start a data movement manager. ">wrench::WMS::createDataMovementManager()</a></code>. Creating these managers typically is the first thing a WMS does. Each manager has its own documented API, and is discussed further in sections below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-data"></a>
Copying workflow data</h1>
<p>The WMS may need to explicitly copy files from one storage service to another storage service, e.g., to improve data locality when executing workflow tasks. File copies are accomplished through the data movement manager, which provides two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_data_movement_manager.html#a815bf4ed2a32b39c0e46a6f5a3c10e51" title="Ask the data manager to perform a synchronous file copy. ">wrench::DataMovementManager::doSynchronousFileCopy()</a></code>: performs a synchronous file copy (i.e., the call will block until the operation completes or fails)</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_data_movement_manager.html#a3ddeb9700a10b5f249b91786e6dddcb0" title="Ask the data manager to initiate an asynchronous file copy. ">wrench::DataMovementManager::initiateAsynchronousFileCopy()</a></code>: performs and asynchronous file copy (i.e., the call returns almost immediately, and an <a href="#wrench-101-WMS-events">event</a> will be generated later on)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods take an optional <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_file_registry_service.html" title="A file registry service (a.k.a. replica catalog) that holds a database of which files are available a...">wrench::FileRegistryService</a></code> argument, in which case they will also update this file registry service with a new entry once the file copy has been completed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-tasks"></a>
Running workflow tasks</h1>
<p>A workflow comprises tasks, and a WMS must pack tasks into <em>jobs</em> to execute them. There are two kinds of jobs in WRENCH: <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_pilot_job.html" title="A pilot (i.e., non-standard) workflow job that can be submitted to a ComputeService by a WMS (via a J...">wrench::PilotJob</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_standard_job.html" title="A standard (i.e., non-pilot) workflow job that can be submitted to a ComputeService by a WMS (via a J...">wrench::StandardJob</a></code>. A pilot job (sometimes called a "placeholder job") is a concept that is mostly relevant for batch scheduling. In a nutshell, it is a job that allows late binding of tasks to resources. It is submitted to a compute service (provided that service supports pilot jobs), and when a pilot job starts it just looks to the WMS like a short-lived compute service to which standard jobs can be submitted.</p>
<p>The most common kind of jobs is the standard job. A standard job is a unit of execution by which a WMS tells a compute service to do things. More specifically, in its most complete form, a standard job specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vector of <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_workflow_task.html" title="A computational task in a Workflow. ">wrench::WorkflowTask</a></code> to execute;</li>
<li>A <code>std::map</code> of <code>&lt;<a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_workflow_file.html" title="A data file used/produced by a WorkflowTask in a Workflow. ">wrench::WorkflowFile</a>*, <a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_storage_service.html" title="The storage service base class. ">wrench::StorageService</a> *&gt;</code> values which specifies from which storage services particular input files should be read and to which storage services output files should be written. (Note that a compute service can be associated to a "by default" storage service upon instantiation);</li>
<li>A set of file copy operations to be performed before executing the tasks;</li>
<li>A set of file copy operations to be performed after executing the tasks; and</li>
<li>A set of file deletion operations to be performed after executing the tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the above can actually be empty, and in the extreme a standard job does nothing.</p>
<p>Standard jobs and pilot jobs are created via the job manager (see multiple versions of the <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#a7f3873e56c8813c90b66683690d6b328" title="Create a standard job. ">wrench::JobManager::createStandardJob()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#a9ef786306730359866e3fd2bd3aadaf7" title="Create a pilot job. ">wrench::JobManager::createPilotJob()</a></code> methods). The job manager thus acts as a job factory, and provides job management methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#a69de09b0d5ae34cbcf9208be88901728" title="Submit a job to compute service. ">wrench::JobManager::submitJob()</a></code>: used to submit a job to a compute service.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#aba90476a89bc0748497879bdf07eea9c" title="Terminate a job (standard or pilot) that hasn&#39;t completed/expired/failed yet. ">wrench::JobManager::terminateJob()</a></code>: used to terminate a previously submitted job.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#ab10f770cc7ce3c022f889ad9cc3fcf0b" title="Forget a job (to free memory, only once a job has completed or failed) ">wrench::JobManager::forgetJob()</a></code>: used to completely remove all data regarding a completed/failed job.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#ad7f55858aa45b87289d5f35c4ccfad56" title="Get the list of currently pending pilot jobs. ">wrench::JobManager::getPendingPilotJobs()</a></code>: used to retrieve a list of previously submitted jobs that have yet to begin executing.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_job_manager.html#aeb91b23edf40378e49929f47e95f1ea6" title="Get the list of currently running pilot jobs. ">wrench::JobManager::getRunningPilotJobs()</a></code>: used to retrieve a list of currently running jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-events"></a>
Workflow execution events</h1>
<p>Because the WMS, in part via the managers, performs many asynchronous operations, it needs to act as an event handler. This is called by calling the <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a2923b4ec6f7e233693199154d5206d5f" title="Wait for a workflow execution event and then call the associated function to process that event...">wrench::WMS::waitForAndProcessNextEvent()</a></code> method implemented by the base <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html" title="A workflow management system (WMS) ">wrench::WMS</a></code> class. A call to this method blocks until some event occurs. The possible event classes all derive the <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_workflow_execution_event.html" title="A class to represent the various execution events that are relevant to the execution of a workflow...">wrench::WorkflowExecutionEvent</a></code> class. A WMS can override a method to react to each possible event (the default method does nothing but print some log message). At the time this documentation is being written, these overridable methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#aa00aeb9c502fc794efb4dbe69e800e49" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::STANDARD_JOB_COMPLETION. ">wrench::WMS::processEventStandardJobCompletion()</a></code>: react to a standard job completion</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a1e33e5ae8d04d96eb8e03444d78a5c52" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::STANDARD_JOB_FAILURE event. ">wrench::WMS::processEventStandardJobFailure()</a></code>: react to a standard job failure</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a2044fcfb8fdd1908f50303d6faf0a2f0" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::PILOT_JOB_START event. ">wrench::WMS::processEventPilotJobStart()</a></code>: react to a pilot job beginning execution</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#ab3b8812e525c47ed3942b8d51b9b31fd" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::PILOT_JOB_EXPIRATION event. ">wrench::WMS::processEventPilotJobExpiration()</a></code>: react to a pilot job expiration</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a61810ee6d81e3eb1d587da28d74bb53e" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::FILE_COPY_COMPLETION event. ">wrench::WMS::processEventFileCopyCompletion()</a></code>: react to a file copy completion</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html#a7aaff45943d82ae56e3d02626cdad6ef" title="Process a WorkflowExecutionEvent::FILE_COPY_FAILURE event. ">wrench::WMS::processEventFileCopyFailure()</a></code>: react to a file copy failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Each method above takes in an event object as parameter, and each even class offers several methods to inspect the meaning of the event. In the case of failure, the event includes a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_failure_cause.html" title="A top-level class to describe all simulation-valid failures that can occur during workflow execution ...">wrench::FailureCause</a></code> object, which can be accessed to understand the root cause of the failure.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-exceptions"></a>
Exceptions</h1>
<p>Most methods in the WRENCH Developer API throw <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_workflow_execution_exception.html" title="An generic exception that is thrown whenever something unexpected (but simulation-valid) occurrs duri...">wrench::WorkflowExecutionException</a></code> instances when exceptions occur. These are exceptions that corresponds to failures during the simulated workflow executions (i.e., errors that would occur in a real-world execution). Each such exception contains a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_failure_cause.html" title="A top-level class to describe all simulation-valid failures that can occur during workflow execution ...">wrench::FailureCause</a></code> object, which can be accessed to understand the root cause of the execution failure. Other exceptions (e.g., <code>std::invalid_arguments</code>, <code>std::runtime_error</code>) are thrown as well, which are used for detecting mis-uses of the WRENCH API or internal WRENCH errors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-schedulers"></a>
Schedulers for decision-making</h1>
<p>A large part of what a WMS does is make decisions. It is often a good idea for decision-making algorithms (often simply called "scheduling algorithms") to be re-usable across multiple WMS implementations, or plug-and-play-able for a single WMS implementation. For this reason, the <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_w_m_s.html" title="A workflow management system (WMS) ">wrench::WMS</a></code> constructor takes as parameters two objects (or null pointers if not needed):</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_standard_job_scheduler.html" title="A (mostly virtual) base class for implementing StandardJob scheduling algorithms to be used by a WMS...">wrench::StandardJobScheduler</a></code>: A class that has a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_pilot_job_scheduler.html#a903c44145dfce2964f90cc856146adbb" title="A method that schedules pilot jobs, according to whatever decision algorithm it implements, over a set of compute services. ">wrench::PilotJobScheduler::schedulePilotJobs()</a></code> method (to be overwritten) that can be invoked at any time by the WMS to submit pilot jobs to compute services.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_pilot_job_scheduler.html" title="A (mostly virtual) base class for implementing PilotJob scheduling algorithms to be used by a WMS...">wrench::PilotJobScheduler</a></code>: A class that has a <code><a class="el" href="classwrench_1_1_standard_job_scheduler.html#a1ef07acfece4706f7f172c740a8015c3" title="A method that schedules tasks (as part of standard jobs), according to whatever decision algorithm it...">wrench::StandardJobScheduler::scheduleTasks()</a></code> method (to be overwritten) that can be invoked at any time by the WMS to submit tasks (inside standard jobs) to compute services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not required, it is possible to implement most (or even all) decision-making in these two methods so at to have a clean separation of concern between the decision-making part of the WMS and the rest of its functionality. This kind of design is used in the simple example provided in the <code>examples/simple-example</code> directory.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="wrench-101-WMS-logging"></a>
Logging</h1>
<p>It is often desirable for the WMS to print log output to the terminal. This is easily accomplished using the <code>wrench::WRENCH_INFO</code>, <code>wrench::WRENCH_DEBUG</code>, and <code>wrench::WRENCH_WARN</code> macros, which are used just like <code>printf</code>. Each of these macros corresponds to a different logging level in SimGrid. See the <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/latest/doc/outcomes_logs.html">SimGrid logging documentation</a> for all details.</p>
